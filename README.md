### The Life (and Struggles) of a Software Developer 


The linked article above is about the struggles that software developers go through while on the job. I liked this article because it both highlighted what developers often struggle with, such as getting used to a work environment or communicating with their team, as well as **gives good solutions on how to work out these issues**. I feel that most software developers, while they are extremely proficient in their work, can sometimes lack in the communication department. Since everyone likes to do their own thing, *independency* is second-nature to them. However, this article shows how to not only start communicating well with your team, but also how to unwind and handle long-working hours. I feel that this article is useful for any aspiring software engineers or computer scientists.
